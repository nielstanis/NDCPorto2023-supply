# Setup - Securing your .NET application software supply-chain, the practical approach! 

A side from having your favorite .NET IDE installed and access to GitHub please look into getting the following tools installed on your machine. 

# Cosign

Alternatively download the platform specific binaries (latest release) from here:

- https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/releases/tag/v1.3.2 (only need CLI)

# GitSign

# JQ

We're going to work a bit with JSON output and JQ will help us out with that.

# Alternative Remote SSH

If you're using Visual Studio Code it's also possible to install the Remote SSH extension and reach out to me (via https://ndcporto.slack.com/archives/D05V4JQ7M24) to get credentials for a server that you can connect to that has all tools needed installed.
